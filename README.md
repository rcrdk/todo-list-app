# ðŸ“‹ React Native To-Do List App

This is a simple React Native app for managing a to-do list developed as a challenge of my latest lessons at [Rocketseat](https://rocketseat.com.br/). It has three core functionalities:

- **Create a task**: Add new tasks to your to-do list.  
- **Remove a task**: Delete tasks when they are no longer needed.  
- **Toggle task status**: Mark tasks as done or undo them.
